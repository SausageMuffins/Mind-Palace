Predatory Publications - question the findings. (some can be just to earn money)


#### Literature Review
**Look at References** - Find related work. 
**Look at papers that cite the current paper**

Separate core and optional papers.

ignore date first -> consider related work as a more important factor

To what extent is paper still relevant?

formulate good opinions:
1. have perspective - what is good and bad?
2. collect literature reviews.
3. cite well
	1. zotero - browser,word can install plugin 
	2. rayyen - dig up papers
