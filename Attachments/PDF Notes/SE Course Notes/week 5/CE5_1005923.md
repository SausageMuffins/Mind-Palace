The program terminates when x is larger than 10 --> x = 11.

Brief Explanation:

The program starts by running ev2.emit("run", count); 
- This indicates that the program will start with line 26 with the emitter ev2 with count 0.

Hence, count = 0 is passed into the "data" parameter and the console log will print "data 0 is received by ev2". 

Subsequently, since promise is resolved (line 5), promise1.then(foo(data)) will execute the function foo(0) with count = 0 being passed into the data parameter.

Whenever foo executes, ev1 will run with data+1 if the current value of data is even whilst ev2 will run with data+1 if the current value data is odd. This will cause the x value to increment by 1 an alternate between ev1 and ev2 until x is larger than 10 which will cause the new promise (line 12) to be resolved (line 14).
