# Overview

The internetwork or more popularly known in it's short form, internet, is a **network of networks**. We are talking about a whole infrastructure in which data can be sent to many other networks/devices. The main uses of the internet can be to connect Internet Service Providers to send data or provide services like APIs.

## Packets

To understand the networks and how they communicate, we start with the most basic unit of data in networking (packets). Packets are literally just "packets or bundles" of information. 

Things we can do with packets:
- Send packets to another end host via [[Networks#Networking Links|communication links]] 
- Reassembled to form more coherent pieces of information

Packets are received on **packet switches** which receives and forward packets to outgoing links.


## Networking Links

These links are also known as **communication links** whose purpose is to forward or receive packets.

There are many types of communication links (different materials) with different transmission rates (speed):
- Coaxial cable
- Copper wire
- Optical fiberÂ 
- Radio spectrum (wireless)

Transmission rates / bandwidth: measure in bits/s.
