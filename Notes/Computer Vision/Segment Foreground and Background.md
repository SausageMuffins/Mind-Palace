## Overview

This topic is quite important as it helps to [[Object Detection|detect objects]] and [[Object Tracking|track them]]. The foreground are typically objects that can be isolated (have a complete edge in a sense).

A simple straight forward way is to [[Contour Detection]]. However, we can also use the [[Watershed Algorithm]] which can be a much better way.
