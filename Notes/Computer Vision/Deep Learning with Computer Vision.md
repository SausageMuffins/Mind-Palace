## Tensors

These are really just n-dimensional arrays - think nested lists! 

(I,H,W,C)

I: Images
H: Height of image
W: Width of image
C: Color of image - 1 grayscale, 3 for RGB

## Densely Neural Network

## Convolutional Neural Network

Great for image processing -> easy to detect nearby pixels. The main idea is to look at a small section of the image as the first layer. Subsequent layers look try to look for more abstract patterns.
