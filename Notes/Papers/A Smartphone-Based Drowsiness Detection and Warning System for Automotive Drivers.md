summary: A paper that uses a three stage fatigue detection system using an android smartphone
---

## Main Idea

The paper seeks to detect fatigue in drivers through a three stage methodology.

1. Assess the "Percentage of Eyelid Closure over the Pupil for the Last Occurrence of Saccade" (PERCLOS). *"A Visual Test"*
2. Compute voiced to unvoiced ratio. *"An Audio Test"*
3. A reaction timed test. *"A Touch Test"*

Each stage happens one after another after the previous stage reaches it's threshold. Once all three reaches the threshold, the driver is determined as "fatigued" and appropriate measures can follow up from the result.
