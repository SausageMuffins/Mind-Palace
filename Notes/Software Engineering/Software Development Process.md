## Software Development Life Cycle SDLC
The process to develop functional software as quickly as possible with minimum cost.

**The stages below do not necessarily need to have an order.**

---

#### Requirements
1. List down client's needs (functional) and wants (non-functional)
2. What is the context of the software - can help in our analysis

**More on Functionalities:**
Consider what is vital for the software to work - Needs. Everything else can be a non-functional requirements such as performance or a theme of the UI.

**More on context:**
Often, systems have multiple contexts (eg: service aspect and business aspect). Take into account these contexts and do the analysis/design respectively.

For instance, make sure the data is very secure if it's in the business aspect or a very friendly UI for a service aspect.

---

#### Analysis
In this part of SLDC, we want to understand how the requirements work together and how each requirement fit in the system. In the real world, we would need to **clarify and flush out more details** in the requirements.

**Important Questions to think about:**
- [ ] Are there any inconsistencies/contradictions in the requirements?
- [ ] Are there any ambiguity/vagueness to the requirements? 
- [ ] What are the key functional modules - do these fit the contexts (non-functional)?
- [ ] Can we abstract/categorize modules into a subsystem? (**analysis classes**)

The end goal of the analysis: **Domain Model**
1. Clear and well defined requirements/specifications
2. Analysis Classes
3. The relationships and connections between every entity/requirements of the system.

Open Questions that I have:



---

#### Design the system


#### Implementation

#### Testing

## Methodologies:

#### CATAB
Stands for Code-a-bit-test-a-bit. This methodology is very common but is not suitable for a larger project/system.

#### Waterfall

#### Rapid Prototyping
