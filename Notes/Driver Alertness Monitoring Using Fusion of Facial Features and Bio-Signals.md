summary: Using multiple features to detect fatigue in drivers
---

## Main Idea
The paper argues for the use of multiple features to have a more accurate assessment of a driver's fatigue levels. Specifically, the paper monitored eye-movements (camera to capture videos) and bio-signal processing.

## Concepts
1. Photoplethysmograph Signals
2. Dynamic Bayesian Network
