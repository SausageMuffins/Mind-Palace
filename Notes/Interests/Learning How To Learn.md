summary: I wrote down my thoughts on how to learn more efficiently.

## Proposed Work Flow
1. **Priming**: Using the GRINDE map to draw out connections between main ideas before the lecture or tutorial. Ideally, we should have a list of open questions before the lecture. *25 minutes for each lecture*
2. **During Lecture**: Focus on listening and take almost no notes other than specific details of a concept/information not found in notes.  *Answer the list of open questions*
3. **After Lecture**: Within the same day (depending on schedule), use *free recall* to flush out gaps in knowledge. We should do free recall on obsidian and record in a MOC. *Multiple sessions of 25 minutes for each lecture*.
4. **Within the Week**: Focus on answering exam-like questions. Eg: Homework, Tutorials. *Before the weekend if possible.*

## Methods
**Before taking notes:**
1. What's the purpose of it?
2. What's the big picture?
3. How can I apply it?
4. Why is the concept important?
5. How is it similar the other concepts I have learnt? 

### GRINDE Map 

This is a specific type of mind map that I will be using to do **priming** and taking notes in lecture.

| **Symbol**          | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grouped         | Facts and concepts can be rearranged and grouped into categories                                                 |
| Reflective      | Notes should be a reflection of what I am thinking about. Avoid linear styles of note-taking!                    |
| Interconnected  | Actively look for more connections that are distant to other concept. Avoid isolated facts                       |
| Non-Verbal      | Reduce the number of words in the notes - Increase diagrams, images, stick figures, drawings etc.                |
| ***Directional*** | Arrange the order of concepts (flow of concepts). Multiple ideas can combine to form another concept (causation) |
| Emphasized | Make the main point very obvious. (eg: thicker lines, fonts, special color)                                                                                                            |

### Map Of Content (MOC)
This is both an organizing and a thinking tool. It should visualize the connections between concepts in a top down approach and it should be very fluid.

The type of MOC that I am interested in making is a "cheat sheet" style where I can easily  and quickly reference content that I don't remember. 

As a secondary function, it should look like a "syllabus" for me to do free recall easily. It should be an overview of what a topic would have.
