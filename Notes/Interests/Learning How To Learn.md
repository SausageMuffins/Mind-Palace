summary: I wrote down my thoughts on how to learn more efficiently.
---
## Proposed Work Flow
1. **Priming**: Using the GRINDE map to draw out connections between main ideas before the lecture or tutorial. Ideally, we should have a list of open questions before the lecture. *25 minutes for each lecture*
2. **During Lecture**: Focus on listening and take almost no notes other than specific details of a concept/information not found in notes. Answer the list of [[Learning How To Learn#^ea87e8|questions]].
3. **After Lecture**: Within the same day (depending on schedule), use [[Learning How To Learn#Free Recall|free recall]] to flush out gaps in knowledge. We should do free recall on obsidian and record in a MOC. *Multiple sessions of 25 minutes for each lecture*. Maximum two to three sessions of free recall for each lecture/topic
4. **Within the Week**: Focus on answering exam-like questions. Eg: Homework, Tutorials. *Before the weekend if possible.*

## Methods
**Before taking notes:** ^ea87e8
1. What's the purpose of it?
2. What's the big picture?
3. How can I apply it?
4. Why is the concept important?
5. How is it similar the other concepts I have learnt? 

### GRINDE Map 

This is a specific type of mind map that I will be using to do **priming** and taking notes in lecture.

| **Symbol**          | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grouped         | Facts and concepts can be rearranged and grouped into categories                                                 |
| Reflective      | Notes should be a reflection of what I am thinking about. Avoid linear styles of note-taking!                    |
| Interconnected  | Actively look for more connections that are distant to other concept. Avoid isolated facts                       |
| Non-Verbal      | Reduce the number of words in the notes - Increase diagrams, images, stick figures, drawings etc.                |
| ***Directional*** | Arrange the order of concepts (flow of concepts). Multiple ideas can combine to form another concept (causation) |
| Emphasized | Make the main point very obvious. (eg: thicker lines, fonts, special color)                                                                                                            |

### Map Of Content (MOC)
This is both an organizing and a thinking tool. It should visualize the connections between concepts in a top down approach and it should be very fluid.

The type of MOC that I am interested in making is a "cheat sheet" style where I can easily  and quickly reference content that I don't remember. 

As a secondary function, it should look like a "syllabus" for me to do free recall easily. It should be an overview of what a topic would have.


### Free Recall
The reason why we want to do free recall is to further deepen the encoding and to retrieve information. I learnt in my psychology module in Term 4 that retrieving helps to retain information.

However, this "free recall" will not be simply flash cards to try to "answer questions". 

| Steps              | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exposure to Material      | Attempt to recall as many links and information as possible after exposure to the material.          |
| Reference Syllabus | After the first recall, look at the syllabus to jolt the memory of things that we forgot. (Reference the MOC here) |

Repeat the steps above over time to retain information about the topic. The session should last between 30 minutes to 1 hour. (two to three 25 minute chunks).

**It should have some cognitive load!** (ie. it should be hard). 

When is it too easy/"mastered" the topic:
1. Can recall all the topics in the MOC
2. Feeling of "writing this concept is slowing me down".
3. Finished within one session

We can always make the topic harder by including more details or trying to link to other topics. This can further strengthen the encoding process and put the information in the long-term memory.

#### Practicing Problems
Ultimately, we want to score well for exams and solve problems. This step should happen the most to focus on relevant problem-solving skills/information that we want to retain.

Try problem sets -> Write open questions.

Generic Types of Open Questions: ^16b1a0
1. Contradicting topics
2. Topics with tensions (relations)
3. Thought processes (for solving problems)
