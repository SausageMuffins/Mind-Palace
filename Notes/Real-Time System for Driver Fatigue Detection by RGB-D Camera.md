summary: Use of RGB-D cameras and CV to detect fatigue.
---

## Main Idea
The paper argues that physiological measures are intrusive and vehicle parameter monitoring are ineffective. Hence, the authors utilized an emergine technology called RGB-D cameras that can sense depth on top of the standard RGB data.

By leveraging on the depth, the system is hypothesized to be able to have a non-invasive and effective method to detect fatigue in drivers.

## Concepts
1. RGB-D
2. Computer Vision
3. SVM
4. WLBP
