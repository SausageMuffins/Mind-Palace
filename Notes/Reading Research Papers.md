summary: Reading a research paper is a skill. In this note, I try to make my approach to this skill more efficient.

## Overview

Reading research papers are a skill. The main objective is to find what is relevant to the topic that I am interested in. The next objective is to look at the details of the paper (results, methodology and assumptions). Ultimately, we want to base our work off of these papers and design a unique/new project or paper.

## Three-Pass Approach
The details of this method can be found [here](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf). The main idea is to look at the paper at most three times to understand the paper and use it as a reference to our study.

#### The First Pass
This step serves to grasp (in general) what the paper is about. It should be very quick (5 - 10 minutes)

- [ ] Read Title, Abstract and Headings only.
- [ ] Read Conclusion in detail.
- [ ] Scan the References to see which paper you have already read.

**Outcome of the First Pass:**
- [ ] Know the type of research paper - (Survey, Experiment or Cause and Effect)
- [ ] Know the concepts related to this paper.
- [ ] Figure out if the paper is valid (assumptions, reputability, contributors, clarity)
- [ ] Know to go ahead with second pass or not.

#### The Second Pass
This step serves to filter out the main points of the paper as well as further determine if this paper is worth reading. This may take up to an hour.

Techniques to consider:
- [ ] Write down comments and highlight key points
- [ ] Study the graphs, figures and any illustrations to look for flaws (insignificant graph, improper labels/axis etc)
- [ ] Mark down relevant unread references for further reading.

**Outcome of the Second Pass:**
- [ ] Be able to summarize the paper.
- [ ] Bring out key concepts/points with supporting evidence.

#### The Third Pass

This step serves to point out **flaws or gaps** in the paper. **It will take some time - a couple hours.**

The main idea of the third pass would be to "virtually re-implement" the paper (recreate the work). Compare this recreation with the actual paper and look for hidden failings and assumptions. *Consider how would you present the same idea of the paper.*

**Outcome of the Third Pass:**
- [ ] Have some ideas for future work that is different from the current paper you are reading.
- [ ] Be able to reconstruct the layout/structure of the paper.
- [ ] Identify the implicit assumptions and gaps of the paper (eg: missing citations or flaws).
- [ ] Produce original content to address the gaps.

## Literature Reviews

1. Look for academic papers in Google Scholar or CiteSeer using keywords (five recent papers in the field)
2. Go through the first pass with these five papers.
3. Look at the related studies of these five papers and go through the first pass. A survey paper would be very helpful :)
4. Identify and look for key papers/researchers and the reputable conferences.
5. Once we have established the key researchers and conferences, look for relevant papers in those .
